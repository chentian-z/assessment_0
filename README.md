# Assessment 0 for Data Science Toolbox

## Project Group
  - Chentian Zhao
  - Mohammed Abulqassim

This project has a 50/50 equity split between the two project members.

## Reading Order and Requirements

Both reports are in the /report directory and are numbered in their reading order:
  - 01-Dataset Review
  - 02-Android Malware Analysis
  - 03-Exploring Cybersec Attacks
  - 04-Wrapup

It is important to run the reports in this order as the first line of 02-Android Malware Analysis contains the code for running all dependencies.
Alternatively, copy and paste the following code if running out of order:

` pip install -r ../requirements.txt `

## Evidence
Our working is shown in our named directories
  - ChentianZ/Exploring Cybersec Attacks.ipynb
  - MohammedA/Android Malware Analysis.ipynb

We worked on all reports together in person for the most part. However, Chentian contributed more to exploring_cybersec_attacks.ipynb and Mohammed
contributed more to android_malware_analysis.ipynb.
